           <p>
            Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. 
            Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in 
            Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE, while the first recorded Olympic Games 
            took place in 776 BCE. 
            Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport.

              “We see something that needs to be done, then figure out how we can do it, 
              rather than not attempting things because they’re hard to do,” Wittenberg says. 
              “What we do here is say, ‘How do we achieve the dream?’”

            In her grand vision for the future, Wittenberg sees this as 
            an interrelated tripartite mission and duty for NYRR, on a local, 
            national and international level. “Our vision is absolutely to be a global 
            leader in running,” she emphatically states,“to influence others 
            in the sport worldwide to achieve goals for the whole sport.”

              Lower Risk of Chronic Disease This is thanks to running being 
              linked to more regulated blood pressure, blood sugar, and body weight, 
              Dr. Walrod says. And if it helps you hit the recommended benchmark of 150 minutes 
              of weekly physical activity, you'll decrease risk of some cancers, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.

              For most people, running four to five days a week should be the max, 
              allowing you ample time for cross-training, strength training and rest. 
              Your level of experience should dictate how frequently you decide to run.
